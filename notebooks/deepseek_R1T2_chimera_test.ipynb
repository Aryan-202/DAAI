      "The question \"What is the meaning of life?\" is one of humanity's oldest and most profound inquiries, resonating across philosophy, religion, science, art, and individual reflection. There is no single, universally accepted answer—it depends on one's perspective, beliefs, and experiences. Here are some ways people approach this question:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. **Philosophical Perspectives**  \n",
      "   - **Existentialism** (e.g., Sartre, Camus): Life has no inherent meaning; it’s up to each person to create their own purpose through choices, actions, and commitments.  \n",
      "   - **Absurdism** (Camus): Human search for meaning clashes with a chaotic, indifferent universe—yet we must embrace life passionately regardless.  \n",
      "   - **Stoicism**: Meaning comes from living virtuously, accepting what we cannot control, and finding harmony with nature or reason.  \n",
      "   - **Utilitarianism**: Life’s purpose lies in maximizing happiness and reducing suffering for the greatest number of people.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Religious/Spiritual Views**  \n",
      "   - **Monotheistic faiths** (Christianity, Islam, Judaism): Life’s purpose centers on love, service to others, relationship with God, and eternal salvation.  \n",
      "   - **Eastern philosophies** (Buddhism, Hinduism): Meaning arises from overcoming suffering (Buddhism), fulfilling dharma (duty), achieving enlightenment, or uniting with the divine (moksha).  \n",
      "   - **Pantheism/Panentheism**: Life is an expression of the divine, and meaning lies in recognizing unity with all existence.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Scientific/Evolutionary Lens**  \n",
      "   - Biology suggests life’s \"purpose\" is survival, reproduction, and adaptation—encoded into DNA.  \n",
      "   - From a cosmic viewpoint, physicist **Carl Sagan** famously said, \"We are a way for the universe to know itself,\" hinting at connection and curiosity as drivers.  \n",
      "   - **Emergent meaning**: While science doesn’t prescribe meaning, it helps us understand our place in the universe, sparking awe and inquiry.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. **Humanistic Approaches**  \n",
      "   - Seek fulfillment through relationships, creativity, growth, or contributions to society (e.g., art, knowledge, justice).  \n",
      "   - Psychologist **Viktor Frankl** (Holocaust survivor) argued meaning is found in three ways: through work, love, and courage in adversity.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. **Absence of Meaning?**  \n",
      "   - **Nihilism**: Life has no objective meaning or intrinsic value—a perspective some find liberating, others despairing.  \n",
      "   - **Optimistic nihilism**: If nothing matters, we’re free to create joy and purpose on our own terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "### A Personal Reflection  \n",
      "Ultimately, the search itself may be part of the answer: to question, connect, create, and grow. **Albert Einstein** once said,  \n",
      "> *\"The meaning of life is to serve others and contribute to the world in a way only you can.\"*\n",
      "\n",
      "How do *you* feel about this question? Are you drawn to a particular framework—or exploring your own path? 🌱\n"
